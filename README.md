##  Backstory

I have been a part of some of Iranian festival celebrations organized by an Iranian friend and co-incidently their festivals fall just a few days before or after ancient Indian festivals. This is not limited to the proximity of dates but also similarity of rituals. Consider the festivals of Mehregan and Holi. Consider the festivals Nowruz and Nevreh. Consider the goddesses Anahita and Saraswati. Consider the Sun god Mithra from ancient Iran and consider the Vedic god Mitra in India. This led to dig a big deeper into the ancient languages of India and Iran and here I am listing common words between these ancient languages that left me speechless. We are more connected than we think. Read the common words to be surprised. ;)
